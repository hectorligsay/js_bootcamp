1️⃣ Read & Reflect (30 min)
✅ Read Ch. 1-3 of Eloquent JavaScript
✅ Summarize the key takeaways in your own words (write 3-5 bullet points).
✅ Optional: Explain one tricky concept in a tweet-length summary.

Chapter 1 Notes:

Values, Types, and Operators:
* Bits are any kind of two valued things which consist of 0s and 1s. This is how you get binary numbers.

Values:
* These are pieces of information that is called from functions, names, variables , etc.

Numbers:
* numeric values / self explanatory

Arithmatic:
* operations used to calculate the numbers 

Special Numbers:
* Infinity but not used a lot 
* NaN : this is most likely an error

Strings:
* You know this already 

Unary Operators:
* things like typeof() 

Boolean Values:
* true/false type shit 
* in JS:
&&      ==      !=      <       >       <=      >=      ||      
===     !==     <--------- These commands to the left cancel out type conversions

Ternary logical operator:
console.log(true ? 1 : 2)
->>>> Returns 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2)
->>>> Returns 2

Empty Values:
* null
* undefined

Auto type conversion:
* This is what makes JS a lil wonky 
* JavaScript knows the type even if you do "5" - 2, it'll know that the 5 is a five and not a string.
* But if we do "five" - 2 , you'll get NaN as an answer cuz it won't convert the string name.

Short-cirtcuiting of Logical Operators:
* console.log (null || "user")
returns user
* console.log("Agnes" || "user")
returns "Anges"
